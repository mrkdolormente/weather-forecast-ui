# Weather Forecast App

This project is develop to easily monitor and access weather updates within the specific location of the user choice. It is build and design in angular framework and utilities. Click here to know more about [Angular](https://angular.io/).

## Get Started

### Clone the Repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mrkdolormente/weather-forecast-ui.git
cd weather-forecast-ui
```

### Install npm packages

```shell
npm install
```

### Development server

You can run either `npm start` or `ng serve` command to run the development server locally.

The `npm start` or `ng serve` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application.
After running the dev server, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The default configuration for this command is set to production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

- `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
- `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
- `npm run build-develop` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once with develop configuration.
- `npm run build-staging` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once with staging configuration.
- `npm run watch` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.

These are the test-related scripts:

- `npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.

## Dependencies

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.

### Angular Material

[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) is a User Interface (UI) component library that developers can use in their Angular projects to speed up the development of elegant and consistent user interfaces.

Angular Material offers you reusable and beautiful UI components like Cards, Inputs, Data Tables, Datepickers, and much more.
